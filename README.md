# Goal 
The goal of this repo is to be able to create a demo example for a use case of `useEffect` hook. 

A function component should be able to use `useEffect` hook, make an api call to github and render that information on the web page.


`<GithubUserInfo/>` is a function component that fulfills the goal.

Note: This code example does not need and perform any cleanup when effects run on every update.
